# DMTS-project

This is a theano implementation of a recurrent neural network to solve a delayed match to sample categorization task. 

Goal is to copy the model from this: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9412516 paper. 

To do:
1) update this readme with more details
2) fancy gradient descent bells and whistles
